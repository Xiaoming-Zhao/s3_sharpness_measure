# S3 Sharpness Measure

This is **an intact mirror** for the original implementation of [S3 sharpness measure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6030937).

- `S3codes_Oct2011.zip` is the zipfile directly downloaded from the author's website
- `S3codes_Oct2011` is the uncompressed content


## Disclaimer

1. **I am not the author of this package.**
2. I have a copy of the original implementation because I use it for [my work at ECCV 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14289). Since [the author's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210822041040/https://sites.google.com/site/cuongvt101/research/Sharpness-measure) is down and the link for the original implementaion disappears, I think it may be beneficial for others if I share the intact copy I have.
3. If you find that there exists an official link to the original implementation, please let me know and I will update this repo.
